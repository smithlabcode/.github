## smithlabcode

This organization is for code produced as a byproduct of our research in computational biology.
All our repos can be found here. Our reseaerch covers diverse topics in computational genomics.
So our code covers diverse topics.
If you have any questions, here are several options:

* Post your question as an issue in the corresponding repo.
* Email the author of the code (which in most cases includes myself, Andrew).
* Email me. My address is in my profile.

We release our code so it might help you. If it's not working properly or optimally,
please ask us and we'll do our best to make it work for you.
